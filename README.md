This is a repo for my study projects from the book "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart.

I am taking a different approach from what I would normally do. Instead of reading everything meticulously, I jump right to Summary, Practice Questions and Projects of each chapter - and only do as much reading as I need to complete the projects. And in projects, I aim for the simplest, quickest working solution without worrying about its elegance. This is also a practice of letting go of my perfectionistic tendencies.
